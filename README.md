## Hi there 👋 I’m Nana

Backend / Full-Stack Software Engineer (**C# · TypeScript**).  
I build practical services and internal tools: clean APIs, reliable data flows, and dashboards teams actually use.

### What I’ve done
- Built backend features + integrations and kept them stable in production
- Turned DB data (and app-generated outputs) into reporting tables/views
- Shipped dashboards and automated reports for stakeholders

### A few projects
- **Health iOS app:** built backend from scratch (**NestJS**, **Fly.io**), auth/profiles + storage (**Supabase**), notifications + in-app purchases, and API contracts for iOS
- **Assistant features:** integrated **OpenAI Assistant API** with RAG + message history for conversational flows
- **Reporting layer:** designed reporting tables/views and dashboard-ready queries
- **Internal admin tools:** data viewers, bulk operations, permission-based workflows

## Hi there 👋 I'm Nana

Backend / Full-Stack Software Engineer (C# · TypeScript).  
I build practical services and internal tools: clean APIs, reliable data flows, and dashboards teams actually use.

### What I’ve done 
- Built backend features + integrations and kept them stable in production
- Pulled and transformed data from databases and AI-produced outputs, created reporting tables/views
- Shipped dashboards and automated reports for stakeholders (so people can make decisions fast)

### A few projects 

- **Health app:** backend infrastructure for an iOS app supporting users through pregnancy; developed services from scratch with TypeScript + NestJS and deployed on Fly.io. Integrated OpenAI Assistant API for conversational flows (incl. RAG + message history), implemented secure auth/profiles and storage via Supabase, and built core modules (content, checkups, notifications, in-app purchases). Collaborated closely with product + iOS teams and owned backend reliability through debugging, refactoring, and maintainable API design.
- **Reporting layer + dashboards:** turned raw DB data + AI-generated signals into metrics and fast dashboard queries  
- **Core backend services:** REST APIs, business logic, reliability improvements (logging, safer errors)  
- **Internal admin tools:** data viewers, bulk operations, permission-based workflows
